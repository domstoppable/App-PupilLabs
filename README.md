# App-PupilLabs

This repository contains various integrations of the [lab streaming layer](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer) framework with Pupil Labs products.

## Neon
* [The Neon Companion app has built-in support for LSL](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/neon/data-collection/lab-streaming-layer/). No additional software is required.

## Pupil Invisible
* To receive and save Pupil Invisible data in realtime via LSL, check out the dedicated [Pupil Labs LSL Relay application](https://pupil-labs-lsl-relay.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
* The legacy Pupil Invisible LSL Relay can be found [here](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-PupilLabs/tree/legacy-pi-lsl-relay/pupil_invisible_lsl_relay).
